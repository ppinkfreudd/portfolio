    <h1>29/11/24 // "Biotommy Two 005 [140bpm]"</h1>
    <p>"Biotommy Two 005 [140bpm]" by Vegyn. If you can, listen as you read this. It's what’s playing in my headphones right now, as I write. I’m writing this from a Starbucks, the only café I could find open this Thanksgiving weekend. All the others were full. Not the best place to support, I realize. There's also a houseless preacher here, standing near the counter. He said, "I was a national laboratory rat," then paused and continued, "'But God told me, 'Don't worry, William. I'll take care of all the details. Love, forgiveness, and mercy.' That's what I'm about. Hallelujah.'" He ended his speech alternating between "Ay-men" and "Ah-men" as if ensuring his prayer reaches the God. He did this four times in a row, deliberate and exact. Eventually, someone asked him to quiet down. It bummed me out.</p>

    <p>English lit. is something I deeply enjoy - the classes, reading books, analyzing stories, all of it. Writing, especially. But I don't do it outside of the classroom. To be honest, the last time I truly wrote was in my last relationship. As if I too was praying, to feel heard, but on paper. I wasn't brave enough to talk it out. It's been more than a year since then, and I've reached a point where I want to write, for myself. There's just so much that has gone by, and I want create a record of it.</p>

    <p>So maybe this is where writing belongs for me. Writing like this, a bit messy and unpolished, feels honest. </p>
