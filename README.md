# Rishit Das's Portfolio
Started this as a vanilla html/css page, and have now added custom scripts and styling. I initially wrote this to practice my html/css, and so I've kept it as such and have avoided out-of-the-box solutions from React and other sources. 

- **Interactive Elements with Javascript**: Includes a typewriter effect, a RAG chatbot interface with OpenAIEmbeddings and Langchain, and a slideshow for project highlights.
